# Fierce-Helios: High-Frequency Trading Bot Project

Our project explores finance technology through the creation of a high-frequency trading (HFT) bot designed to capitalize on short-term market inefficiencies. 
By implementing three high-probability trading setups—**mean reversion**, **momentum ignition**, and **bid-ask spread** strategies—our bot will aim to identify and 
execute profitable trades in real-time.

### Project Objectives
The main objectives of this project are:
1. **Develop a high-frequency trading algorithm** capable of executing trades in milliseconds.
2. **Utilize statistical analysis and basic machine learning techniques** to identify profitable trading opportunities.
3. **Backtest strategies using historical data** to ensure algorithm reliability and profitability.
4. **Build a robust real-time data acquisition system** and integrate it into a high-performance computing environment for low-latency execution.

### Trading Strategies
Our HFT bot will be based on the following three setups:

1. **Mean Reversion**  
   - This setup detects asset price deviations from historical averages, executing trades with a hedged position in anticipation of a price reversion.
   - Key focus: statistical signals, price deviation, and hedging.

2. **Momentum Ignition**  
   - The bot will identify emerging volume trends and execute trades in the direction of these movements, profiting from short- to medium-term momentum.
   - Key focus: trend identification, volume analysis, and real-time price tracking.

3. **Bid-Ask Spread**  
   - This market-making strategy focuses on scalping small profits by trading on the bid-ask spread in highly volatile, liquid markets.
   - Key focus: bid-ask analysis, quick order execution, and spread sensitivity.

These strategies will be dynamically managed by the bot, adjusting to market conditions using real-time risk management techniques such as position sizing and automated stop-loss mechanisms.

### Key Components
1. **Real-Time Data Acquisition**  
   - Implementation of a system for low-latency market data feeds.
   - Integration with high-performance computing platforms for quick response times.

2. **Backtesting Framework**  
   - Framework to test strategy effectiveness on historical data to ensure stability and reliability.

3. **Risk Management**  
   - Real-time monitoring of open positions with automated risk mitigation techniques.
   - Position sizing and automated stop-loss settings to minimize losses.

4. **Regulatory Compliance**  
   - Compliance considerations will be factored into the bot’s design to adhere to financial market standards.

### Expected Outcome
The outcome of this project will demonstrate our proficiency in implementing algorithmic trading techniques. It will serve as a practical platform to test our knowledge of finance technology, market microstructure, and high-performance computing.
